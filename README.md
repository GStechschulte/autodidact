# Self Learning

A place for programming and experimenting with the things I find interesting at any particular moment in time. 

What this is not: Tutorials

## Applied [Statistics](Statistics)

Key Theorems, Laws, and algorithms

## [Probability](Probability) and [Information Theory](Information_Theory)

Will probably be mainly Bayesian material

[KL Divergence](Probability/KL_Divergence.ipynb)
[Mutual Information](Mutual_Information.ipynb)
[MLE and MAP](Statistics/MLE.ipynb)

## [Linear Algebra](Linear_Algebra)

A refresher on first principles

## [Machine Learning From Scratch](ML_Scratch)

Common ML algorithms and concepts implemented from scratch
 - [Logistic Regression](ML_Scratch/LogisticRegression.ipynb)
 - [Generative Classifer](ML_Scratch/KDE.ipynb)
 - [Gradient Descent](ML_Scratch/GradientDescent.ipynb)
 - [Kernel Functions](ML_Scratch/KernelFunctions.ipynb)
